# DOM Times Table
Create a web page that generates a times table.

Your web page should include an input of type `number` and a button. Users
should be able to enter a number they want to see a times table of and press
the button to generate the table.

The top row and left column should be the numbers 0-N where `N` is the number
input by the user. Do not generate a new table for numbers less than one.

Use for loops, functions and parameters to reduce redundant behavior like
creating rows.

There is no HTML, CSS or JavaScript provided as a starting point for this
project.

## Times Tables (Multiplication Tables)
Here's a times table for the number three:

```
1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9
```

Here's what that table looks like in HTML.

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>9</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
